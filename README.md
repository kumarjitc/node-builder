# node-builder

Purpose of this application is to provide an web interface for the build tasks(Currently works nice with Angular builds, didn't test with other builds)

Tech Stack
 - Angular 10
 - Express
 - SocketIO
 - NEDB

A Failed Attempt
 - Server Side Code looks really bad
 - Application is half baked, but works
 - Workflow area is not working at all, there are quite a few things to take care
